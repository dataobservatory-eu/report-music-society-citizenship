In the European union, there are huge expectations associated with the creative industries. Based on the following findings, we can conclude that the low level of external investments is caused by the low possibility to get the loans. There is no relation between the regional density of supporting sectors’ enterprises and the economic results reached by these regions.},

The development and degree of concentration in the sector is an essential factor characterizing the level of the competitive environment and its exact definition is based on the system of quantitative characteristics that are part of the analytical materials of the institutions dealing with the enforcement of competition rules in most developed economies.},

   abstract = {<b>Research background:<b/> To achieve long-term sustainability, it is necessary to strive for a green economy and come up with solutions to address limitations to resource footprints. This will require innovations across the board and creativity in all fields. Creativity and sustainability are closely linked. The sustainable development requires concerted efforts towards building an inclusive and resilient future for the planet. Innovation, the business of ideas, is increasingly seen as the key to future societal prosperity and business success.<b>Purpose of the article:<b/> The aim of the paper is to analyse the sustainable development of the most globalized sectors of the creative industries in Slovakia mainly measured by the value added. The value added according to Kalecki (1990) is the sum of wages and profits of the companies.<b>Methods:<b/> Sustainability, innovation and value creation (or value added) are nowadays the object of particular attention by the various stakeholders as economic institutions, public and governments.<b>Findings & Value added:<b/> This is the ﬁrst research paper which has used the data on value added recently calculated for the media, publishers and software enterprises, which represent the most globalized sectors of the creative industries in Slovakia. The companies with the highest value added have reached the sustainable development and the best economic performance within the media, publishers and software enterprises’ sector.},

The compensation payments consist of a certain percentage of the income from the year 2019 and encompass business expenses such as rent and other fixed costs.<b>Methods:<b/> Our calculations on the extent to which the creative industries (CIs) and its sub-markets are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are based on data from Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic, the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic and the FINSTAT database for the year 2019 and 2020.<b>Findings & Value added:<b/> The effects of the ordered closures and the associated effects in the individual sub-sectors and occupational fields are estimated. For this reason, economic effects are calculated and recorded based on a scenario analysis. In a second step, the international perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic will be considered. Overall, the analysis of the consequences of the pandemic for the creative industries is intended to provide an overview of the possible consequences in the creative industries and, together with the knowledge about the procedures in other countries, to make political action needs more clearly recognisable.},

   abstract = {Creativity has been considered a new type of competitive advantage in recent years. It becomes the basis of a new direction, a new economic paradigm - creative economy. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the economic performance of creative industries in the publishing segment. The indicator dependence of profit on sales, with the exception of other publishing activities (issuing stamps, checks, banknotes, etc.), reaches Multiple R values close to 1, it confirms a strong addiction, it is moving in the range of 0.98-0.36. The strongest dependence is shown in other software publishing activities. The strong dependence of profit on sales is a signal for the companies to carefully monitor the causes of changes in their revenues, to use qualified tools to increase revenues such as discounts, rebates, delivery terms, etc. The dependence of profit on assets shows lower values, with the exception of publishing magazines and periodicals, Multiple R is in the range of 0.99-0.50. The protection of intellectual property thus becomes an elementary precondition for preserving the potential of the creative and cultural industries. There is a need to raise European citizens' awareness of the value of copyright, as well as the benefits for the development of a prosperous European legal market.},

They supply the economic growth and development over and above their addition to culture and society.<b>Purpose of the article:<b/> The aim of this paper is to analyse the two models that present the two potential answers to the research question: namely expansion and modernization. This paper will summarize these two models and assemble a sample of remaining evidence to set up the process of separating among them.<b>Methods:<b/> However, this paper does not seek a complete study. For that, a much more precise approach to modelling, data and statistical analysis would be required. We provide here only a concept of the classes of models suggested and an explanation of how different sorts of data might be applied to them. The model of economic growth actively involves the creative industries in the growth of the whole economy. The second model – model of innovation as suggested for the effect of science, education and technology in the national systems of innovation approach. The creative industries, in the second model, come from and integrate change in the knowledge base of the economy.<b>Findings & Value added<b/>: We proposed the two possible primary relations between the creative industries’ entities and the rest of the economy.
